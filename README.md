# Public_API_Requests
 
Built an app for a fictional company called 'Awesome Startup', a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world that needed a smart and convenient way for those employees to share contact information with each other.

Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information fo 12 randomly generated 'employees,' we build a prototype for an 'Awesome Startup' employee directory.

This is done by requesting a JSON object from the API and parsing the data so that the 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.
